## Environment
I'm using a `python3.8` virtual environment. To run different versions of
python alongside each other in Ubuntu, I used the [deadsnakes
PPA](https://github.com/deadsnakes). A 
tutorial for Ubuntu can be found [here](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-python-3-8-on-ubuntu-18-04).
Once installed, use the following steps:\
`$ python3.8 -m venv [name of environment]`\
`$ source [name of environment]/bin/activate`\
`$ pip install opencv-python matplotlib`\
Now you should be able to run `main.py` locally.
